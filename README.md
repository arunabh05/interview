TDD Interview Questions
=========

Three simple interview questions with unit tests and stub methods. 

Ideally you should fork this repo, clone it from your own account, complete the exercise, and push it back up to your fork of the repo.

These are not intended to be difficult. You should be able to complete each one in five to ten minutes or less. The best way to work on these is to download them and then work on them with someone watching and asking questions. Use Skype or join.me to share your screen and work through the problems while explaining your thought process.
